GravityControls
===============
A simple application for controlling your device's music stream
with the built-in accelerometer. Simply flip over your device to
stop or mute your music. Flip the device back upright to resume.

Great for when you're listening to music at your desk and someone
stops over to ask you a quick question. No need to fumble with a 
lock screen or unplug your headphones.
